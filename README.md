# Filtered Bicing Data

Filtered data for the bicing visualization project (VI). From here you can read the data online with google colab easily. There is another file containing meteorological data of January 2020.

Both files were extracted from [Open Data Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en) and preprocessed to use them for visualizations.

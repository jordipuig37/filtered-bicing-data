# Filtered Bicing Data

Filtered data for the bicing visualizations projects (VI). From here you can read the data online with google colab easily.

In this repository we save data used in two projects. The first only analyzed data from three stations we choosed:

1. __Ronda St. Pau, 51__
2. __Av. Diagonal, 602__
3. __C/ de les Escoles Pies, 99__

The second analyzed deta from all the stations in Barcelona. All the data is from January 2020.

#### Extra comments

* The file `2020_01_bikes_per_hour.csv` contains information of the three stations.

* The file `2020_01_daily_activity.csv` contain the total activity (pick-ups and drop-offs) of every station for each day of the month.

* Both `2020_01_windowed_wide.csv` and `2020_01_windowed_long.csv` contain the sum of activity from 06:00 to 22:00 for each day separated by pick-ups and drop-offs.

All files were extracted from [Open Data Barcelona](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en) and preprocessed to use them for visualizations.
